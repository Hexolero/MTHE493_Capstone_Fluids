# MTHE493 Thesis Project - Using Vortices for Propulsion
This repository contains all the MATLAB code used to develop a fluid model for our capstone (thesis) project. The aim of this project was to develop a method of generating flows around a given body, then to implement a fixed-timestep simulation and use a control algorithm to minimize some appropriate cost function in piloting our fish-like body through a field of vortices.

Currently, the working portion of the project is generation of a flow around a body (given a set of vortices and a freestream). This is demonstrated below, for two vortices (one to the left of the body, and one above) and a freestream pointing northeast.

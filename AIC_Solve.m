function [ lambda ] = AIC_Solve( controlPoints, flowFieldFnHandle )
%% AIC_Solve - This function computes the aerodynamic influence coefficient
% (AIC) matrix for a given set of control points (defining the body shape)
% and a given (FUNCTION HANDLE) flow field function. Note that the last
% control point is assumed to connect to the first one, so as to make the
% body properly closed.
% Once the function computes the AIC matrix A, it uses it to solve for the
% density coefficients of each panel by inverting the associated matrix
% equation (A*lambda = b <=> lambda = A^-1 * b). These lambda values are
% then returned as the function output.
% NB: controlPoints is passed as a 2-column matrix, each row w/ 1 point.

[N, ~] = size(controlPoints);

% general procedure: A_ij = the untreated (density 1) velocity from sheet j
% at the midpoint of sheet i * the normal direction of sheet i

%% 1. Compute the normal directions for each sheet
% normals are vectors, so like controlPoints will be a 2-column matrix.

    normals(i, :) = normals(i, :) / norm(normals(i, :));
end

    for j=1:N
        CA = controlPoints(j, :);
        CB = controlPoints(mod(j, N) + 1, :);
